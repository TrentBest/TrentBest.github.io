Senior Unity Developer Application - Trent Best

Hello,

My name is Trent Best, and I'm applying for the Senior Unity Developer position.

I've spent over 15 years developing custom, high-performance software and systems for demanding clients like Amazon, NASA, and Apple. My career is defined by my ability to learn, master, and innovate within complex technical domains without prior training.

While my professional experience is in the AEC industry, the core of my work has always been C# programming, data-oriented design, and creating scalable, precise solutionsâ€”the same principles that drive top-tier game development.

Please find my resume attached. My GitHub profile, which includes my FSM_API and Unity integration work, is also available for review at https://github.com/TrentBest/TrentBest.github.io.

I'm hoping my unique background provides the "outside the box" perspective you're looking for to build something truly innovative. I am ready to get to work.

Best regards,

Trent Best
